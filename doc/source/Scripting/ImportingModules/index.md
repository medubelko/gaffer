# Importing Modules #

Each node type in Gaffer is a different Python class, sourced from one of the various Gaffer modules. Each module declares nodes of a particular category, designed to perform a certain kind of task or process. When creating nodes by script, a node's module first needs to be imported using `import`.

A full list of modules and their nodes can be found in the [Node Reference](../../../Reference/NodeReference/index.md).
