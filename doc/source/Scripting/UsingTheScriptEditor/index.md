# Using the Script Editor #

Gaffer's _Script Editor_ functions much like any other basic text editor. In the input text field, you can type, select, copy, paste. Once your code is complete, you can execute it. The top-half of the _Script Editor_ is the code output, and displays your executed code, its output values, and any errors.


## Executing Code ##

By default, after you execute code, the input field is erased. However, you can preserve code by selecting it. To execute code using the _Script Editor_:

1. Type or paste code into the input text field.
    - If you need to preserve your code for later, select some or all of the code.

2. Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The code you execute and any of its results will appear in the output. Any selected portions of your code will remain in the input field.
