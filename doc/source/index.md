# Introduction #

Welcome to the Gaffer user guide and reference documentation.

This guide will provide instructions for how to use Gaffer to complete tasks relevant to both enthusiasts and studios in the VFX domains of look development, lighting, and automatic production and QC. It will also provide reference information for keyboard shortcuts, node types, and scripting commands.

To learn more about Gaffer, visit our website: [https://gafferhq.org](https://gafferhq.org)

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume you have intermediate knowledge of VFX, its terminology, its methods, and its processes. We will also assume you have at least basic familiarity with using Linux and programming paradigms.

Understanding Gaffer will require learning some new terminology. Some Gaffer-specific vocabulary differs from common VFX conventions. If at any point you come across an unfamiliar or confusing term, you can look it up in the [Glossary](Appendices/Glossary.md).

We strive to keep Gaffer and its documentation bug free and up-to-date. If you find any bugs with the software, or inaccuracies with this document, we will be very appreciative if you report it to us on our [GitHub project's Issues page](https://github.com/gafferhq/gaffer/issues).
